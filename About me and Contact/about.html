<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate problem solver with a strong dedication to automation and innovative approaches to enhancing business efficiency. 
  In my free time, I enjoy engaging in puzzles and practicing therapeutic painting. My artistic focus often revolves around vibrant, 
  colorful cakes and sweet treats, and I occasionally try my hand at baking as well.
</p>
<p>Colleagues describe me as proactive, hands-on, and results-driven person, consistently delivering high-quality work. I take pride in my 
integrity, consultative approach, and adaptability.
</p>
<p>My global experiences, having lived and worked in New Zealand, the UK, and now Portugal, have enriched me with a diverse set of skills
   and perspectives. These valuable experiences have been instrumental in my professional growth and development.
